Authentication Issue : If you are not being able to login into your account or create your new account then u have to 1st allow "third-party cookies" in your web browser ! 
REASON : Since my BACKEND and FRONTEND are hosted in different domains (Verce and Render)
SOLUTION : 
    Use a proxy to make cookies first-party.
    Switch to token-based authentication without cookies.
    Use a custom domain for both frontend and backend.

    The easiest and most secure solution is to use token-based authentication with the Authorization header, as it avoids cookies altogether and works seamlessly across different domains.
